## Next step:
- Read [this](https://www.astera.com/type/blog/what-is-data-warehousing/) and write a short summary
- Go through the lecture slides and write a short summary
- Check [this](https://www.dataengineering.academy/pipeline-data-engineering-academy-blog/the-data-engineering-portfolio-project) site and its projects (ecpacially the one with the hiphop recommendation thing)
- Watch an introductino about AWS (What are the gains of using cloud based servises? What do everybody mean with 'learn cloud computing'? If it's just storing data remotely we can also mimic it for this project)- html5 reinziehen for proper web scraping. [These](https://www.w3schools.com/) guys do a good job for the first contact! Also for php, js, css, ...
- Create a seperate venv for this project! (For now I just use my default one!)

## log:
### (28.12.21) 
- started today, not clear what exactly to work on. So first research about basics and possible projects. 
- learned about 'git config --global credential.helper store' and '$PS1' today
### (02.01.22)
- Here are the two networks we might use (from Hugging Face): [Sentiment analysis for text](https://huggingface.co/finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis) and [Speech Emotion Recognition](https://huggingface.co/finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis). ([Here](file:///C:/Users/MONTAP~1/AppData/Local/Temp/kisang.pdf) some rough overview over the technique and [Here](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-20-learning-the-structure-of-speech-from-raw-audio/) a facebook post on the network.)
